# Utility-costs

[This excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/caaficus/Utility-costs/blob/main/Utility_cost_calculation_2020.xlsx) can be used to calculate the utility costs of a variety of services. The formulas and coefficients were taken from the report by [Ulrich and Vasudevan](https://github.com/caaficus/Utility-costs/blob/main/Ulrich%20and%20Vasudevan%20-%20How%20to%20Estimate%20Utility%20Costs.pdf) 

## User Interface

The excel spreadsheet has 5 tabs: **Input, coefficientes, CEPCI, Utility costs and Natural gas price**.

**1. Input:** Here you enter the requested information for the utility you wan to estimate the cost. Check the range of the parameters that you should include in the **value column**

**2. Coefficients:**  These are the values reported by the authors in Table 1 of the document. 

**3. CEPCI (Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index):** This index is published monthly by the [Magazine of Chemical Engineering](https://www.chemengonline.com/pci-home). 

**4. Utility Costs:** Here you can see the formula to estimate the utility cost using as parameter the coefficients, CEPCI and fuel price. Here you find the utility cost based on your inputs. 

**5. Natural gas Price:** Data of the market price for natural gas extracted from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_pc_203/default/table?lang=en)

## Final Remarks

You can add another fuel (e.g., diesel, nuclear, coal, oil,etc) to estimate the price of your utility.
